      In publishing and graphic design, lorem ipsum (derived from Latin dolorem ipsum,
      translated as "pain itself") is a filler text commonly used to demonstrate
      the graphic elements of a document or visual presentation. Replacing meaningful
      content with placeholder text allows designers to design the form of the content
      before the content itself has been produced.[citation needed]
    </p>
    <p>
      The lorem ipsum text is
      typically a scrambled section of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC Latin
      text by Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical, improper Latin.
      [citation needed]A variation of the ordinary lorem ipsum text has been used in
      typesetting since the 1960s or earlier, when it was popularized by advertisements
      for Letraset transfer sheets. It was introduced to the Information Age in the mid-1980s
      by Aldus Corporation, which employed it in graphics and word-processing templates
      for its desktop publishing program
