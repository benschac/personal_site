From the book:

Base rules are the defaults. They are almost exclusively single element selectors
but it could include attribute selectors, pseudo-class selectors,
child selectors or sibling selectors.
Essentially, a base style says that wherever this element is on the page,
it should look like this.

Layout rules divide the page into sections.
Layouts hold one or more modules together.

/*
From the book:

Modules are the reusable, modular parts of our design. They are the callouts,
the sidebar sections, the product lists and so on.


To-do: each one of these will be a different module.

Theme rules are similar to state rules in that they describe how modules or
layouts might look. Most sites donâ€™t require a layer of theming but it is good to be aware of it.
